🏬 Retail Store Sales Dashboard – Power BI
📊 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes sales performance data from a retail store to uncover patterns and insights across product categories, customer demographics, and time periods.
The goal is to understand the reasons behind sales fluctuations, identify top-performing segments, and recommend strategies to improve overall business performance.
